1) HSMM <- detect genes (HSMM, min_expr = ?)
?: Label whether genes are expressed or not in each cell with this minimum

2) expressed_genes <- row.names(subset(fData(HSMM), num... >= ?))
?: List genes label expressed in more than ? cells based on metric in #1

3) (Only in monocle.R) marker_genes
List of marker genes decided by authors

4) diff_test_res <- diffGeneTest(HSMM[marker/expressed genes])
Measure significance of gene expresssion changes across phenotype groups (ex.: media)

5) ordering_genes <- row.names(subset(diff_test_res.qual < ?))
Pick genes going to be used to order cells in pseudotime, genes that cshange in expression across phenodata

6) ordering_genes <- intersect(ordering_genes, expressed_genes)
Further narrow down ordering genes list
